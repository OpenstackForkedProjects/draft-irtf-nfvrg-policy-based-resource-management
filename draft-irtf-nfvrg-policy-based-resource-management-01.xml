<section title="Introduction">

<t>
NFV "Point of Presence" (PoP) will be likely constrained in compute and storage capacity. Since practically all NFV PoPs are foreseen to be distributed, inter-datacenter network capacity is also a constraint.  Additionally, energy is also a constraint, both as a general concern for NFV operators, and in particular for specific-purpose NFV PoPs such as those in mobile base stations. This draft focuses on the optimized resource management and workload distribution based on policy to address such contraints.</t>

<t>In <xref target="fig:MANO-policies"/> we show various policies
mapped to the MANO architecture (see <xref target="sec:policies_mano"/> for
more dicussions on policies in the MANO architeture):
<list style="symbols">
  <t>Tenant Policies: Tenant policies exist whenever a domain offers a
  virtualization service to more than one consumer. User tenants may
  exists at the northbound of the NFVO. Additionally, if a VIM exposes
  resource services to more than one NFVO, then each NFVO may appear
  as a tenant (virtualization consumer) at the northbound of the
  VIM.</t>

  <t>Wherever virtualization services are produced or consumed
  corresponding export and import policies may exist.  Export policies
  govern the details of resources, capabilities, costs, etc. exposed
  to consumers. In turn, consumers (tenants) apply import policies to
  filter, tweak, annotate resources and services received from their
  southbound domains.  An entity may at the same time consume and
  produce virtualization services hence apply both import and export
  policies.</t>

  <t>Operational policies support the business logic realized by the
  domain's ownership. They are often associated with Operations or
  Business Support Systems (OSS or BSS) and frequently determine
  operational objectives like energy optimization, utilization
  targets, offered services, charging models, etc. Operational policies
  may be split according to different control plane layers, for
  example, i) lifecycle and ii) resource management layers within the
  NFVO. </t>

<section anchor="sec:policies_mano" title="Policies in the MANO Architecture">

<t>
The current industry work in the area of policy for NFV is mostly considered in
the framework of general cloud services, and typically focused on
individual subsystems and addressing very specific use cases or
environments. For example, <xref target='ETSI-NFV-WHITE-PAPER' />
addresses network subsystem policy for network virtualization, <xref
target='ODL-GB-POLICY' /> and <xref target='ODL-NIC-PROJECT' /> are
open source projects in the area of network policy as part of the
OpenDaylight <xref target='ODL-SDN-CONTROLLER' /> software defined
networking (SDN) controller framework, <xref target='RFC3060' />
specifies an information model for network policy, <xref
target='VM-HOSTING-NET-CLUSTER' /> focuses on placement and migration
policies for distributed virtual computing, <xref
target='OPENSTACK-CONGRESS' /> is an open source project proposal in
OpenStack <xref target='OPENSTACK' /> to address policy for general
cloud environments.
</t>

<t>
A policy framework applicable to the MANO architure must consider
NFV services from the perspective of overall
orchestration requirements for services involving multiple subsystems (e.g.,
<xref target="fig:NFV-functional-split"/> and  <xref target="fig:MANO-policies"/>).
</t>

<t>
While this document discusses policy atributes as applicable to the
MANO architecture, the general topic of policy has already been intensively studied
and documented on numerous publications over the past 10 to 15 years
(see  <xref target='RFC3060' />, <xref target='POLICY-FRAMEWORK-WG' />,
<xref target='RFC3670' />, <xref target='RFC3198' />, and
<xref target='CERI-DATALOG' /> to name a few).
This document's purpose is to discuss and document a policy
framework applicable to the MANO architecture using known policy concepts
and theories to address the unique requirements of NFV services including
multiple PoPs and networks forming hierarchical domain architectures
<xref target='SDN-MULTI-DOMAIN' />.
</t>

<t>
With the above goals, this document analyses
"global versus local policies" (<xref target="sec:global_local"/>),
a "hierarchical policy framework" (<xref target="sec:hierarc_framework"/>)
to address the demanding and growing requirements of NFV environments,
a "policy pub/sub bus in the hierarchical framework"
(<xref target="sec:pub_sub_bus"/>),
"policy intent versus subsystem actions" (<xref target="sec:policy_intent"/>),
"static versus dynamic versus autonomic policies" (<xref target="sec:static_dynamic"/>),
"policy conflict detection and resolution" (<xref target="sec:conflicts_resolution"/>),
and "soft versus hard policy constraints" (<xref target="sec:soft_hard"/>),
which can be relevant to resource management in service chains
<xref target='RESOURCE-MGMT-SERVICE-CHAIN' />.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor="sec:global_local" title="Global vs Local Policies">

<t>
Some policies may be subsystem specific in scope, while others may have broader scope and interact with multiple subsystems. For example, a policy constraining certain customer types (or specific customers) to only use certain server types for VNF or Virtual Machine (VM) deployment would be within the scope of the compute subsystem. A policy dictating that a given customer type (or specific customers) must be given "platinum treatment" could have different implications on different subsystems. As shown in <xref target='fig_example_translations_policy_actions' />, that "platinum treatment" could be translated to servers of a given performance specification in a compute subsystem and storage of a given performance specification in a storage subsystem.
</t>

<t>
Policies with broader scope, or global policies, would be defined outside affected subsystems and enforced by a global policy engine (<xref target='fig_global_local_policy_engines' />), while subsystem-specific policies or local policies, would be defined and enforced at the local policy engines of the respective subsystems.
</t>

<t>
Examples of sub-system policies can include thresholds for utilization of sub-system resources, affinity/anti-affinity constraints with regard to utilization or mapping of sub-system resources for specific tasks, network services, or workloads, or monitoring constraints regarding under-utilization or over- utilization of sub-system resources.

<section anchor="sec:hierarc_framework" title="Hierarchical Policy Framework">

<t>
So far, we have referenced compute, network, and storage as subsystems
examples. However, the following subsystems may also support policy
engines and subsystem specific policies:
<list style='symbols'>
  <t>SDN Controllers, e.g., OpenDaylight <xref
  target='ODL-SDN-CONTROLLER' />.</t>
  <t>OpenStack <xref target='OPENSTACK' /> components such as,
  Neutron, Cinder, Nova, and etc.</t>
  <t>Directories, e.g., LDAP, ActiveDirectory, and etc.</t>
  <t>
    Applications in general, e.g., standalone or on top of OpenDaylight or OpenStack.
  </t>
  <t>
    Physical and virtual network elements, e.g., routers, firewalls, application delivery controllers (ADCs), and etc.
  </t>
  <t>
    Energy subsystems, e.g., OpenStack Neat <xref target='OPENSTACK-NEAT' />.
  </t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Therefore, a policy framework may involve a multitude of subsystems.  Subsystems may include other lower level subsystems, e.g., Neutron <xref target='OPENSTACK-NEUTRON' /> would be a lower level subsystem in the OpenStack subsystem. In other words, the policy framework is hierarchical in nature, where the policy engine of a subsystem may be viewed as a higher level policy engine by lower level subsystems. In fact, the global policy engine in <xref target='fig_global_local_policy_engines' /> could be the policy engine of a Data Center subsystem and multiple Data Center subsystems could be grouped in a region containing a region global policy engine. In addition, one could define regions inside regions, hierarchically, as shown in <xref target='fig_hierachical_policy_framework' />.
</t>

<t>
Metro and wide-area network (WAN) used to interconnect data centers would also be independent subsystems with their own policy engines.

<t>
A higher tier policy engine would communicate policies to lower tier
policy engines using a policy pub/sub bus.  Conversely, lower tier
policy engines would communicate their configured policies and
services to the higher tier policy engine using the same policy
pub/sub bus. Such communications require each policy pub/sub bus to
have a pre-defined/pre-configured policy "name space". For example, a
pub/sub bus could define services using the name space "Platinum",
"Gold", and "Silver". A policy could then be communicated over that
pub/sub bus specifying a Silver service requirement.
</t>

<t>
In a hierarchical policy framework, a policy engine may use more than
one policy pub/sub bus, e.g., a policy pub/sub bus named "H" to
communicate with a higher tier policy engine and a policy pub/sub bus
named "L" to communicate with lower tier policy engines. As the name
spaces of policy pub/sub buses H and L may be different, the policy
engine would translate policies defined using the policy pub/sub bus H
name space to policies defined using the policy pub/sub bus L name
space, and vice-versa.</t>

<section anchor="sec:pub_sub_in_hierach" title="Pub/sub bus in the hierarchical framework">

<t>
<xref target="fig:pub_sub_in_hierch"/> shows the Pub/sub bus in the hierarchical
MANO framework. Policy communications would employ a policy
pub/sub bus between the subsystems' policy engines in the policy
hierarchy (see <xref target="sec:hierarc_framework"/>). The global NFVO subsystem should have
visibility into the policies defined locally at each PoP to be able
to detect any potential global policy conflicts, e.g., a local PoP
administrator could add a local policy that violates or conflicts
with a global policy. In addition, the global NFVO subsystem would
benefit from being able to import the currently configured services
at each PoP. The global NFVO would use such information to monitor
global policy conformance and also to facilitate detection of policy
violations when new global policies are created, e.g., a global level
administrator is about to add a new global policy that, if committed,
would make certain already configured services a violation of the
policy. The publication of subsystem service tables for consumption
by a global policy engine is a concept used in the Congress <xref target='OPENSTACK-CONGRESS' /> 
OpenStack  <xref target='OPENSTACK' /> project.

		<t>
		Another subsystem example for the policy framework is VNF-FG.
    </t>
    
    <t>
    While the target KPIs of individual VNFs and VLs are pre-configured in their 
    descriptors, the KPIs of a network service instance are determined by 
    coupled performances and capabilities of VNF instances and VL instances that 
    constitute the VNF-FG. For example, if one of the VNF instances or VL 
    instances along the VNF-FG gets overloaded, the end-to-end network service 
    may also get affected. Thus, the chained performances and capabilities of 
    VNF and VL instances need to be considered at enforcing the service 
    policies.
    </t>
    
    <t>
    Another important factor for VLs is the inter-connectivity between different 
    NFVI-PoPs, which is an enabler of resource sharing among different NFVI-PoPs.
    When the VNF instances of a network service are allocated at different 
    NFVI-PoPs, the NFVI-PoP interconnect may be a bottleneck point of the VNF-FG 
    which needs to be monitored to support KPIs of the network service.
    </t>
    
    <t>
    In order to address the aforementioned considerations, it is required to 
    support resource management capability for VNF-FG by considering resource 
    state or KPIs of VNF instances and VL instances which connect them. The 
    resource management operations for VNF-FG are related to the following 
    operations in VNFM and VIM:
    </t>

  	<t>
    	<list style='symbols'>
    		<t>Locate VNF instances</t>
    		<t>Evaluate the performance of VNF instances and VL instances</t>
    		<t>Relocate (or scale) VNF instances</t>
    		<t>Monitor state or KPIs of a VNF instance, VL instances including NFVI-PoP interconnects</t>
    	</list>
    </t>

    <t>
    Studies about evaluation methodologies and performance metrics for VNF instances and 
    NFVI resources can be found at <xref target="ETSI-NFV-PER001"/>
    <xref target="I-D.liu-bmwg-virtual-network-benchmark"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-bmwg-virtual-net"/>. 
    The performance metrics of VNF instances and VL instances related to VNF-FG can be defined 
    as follows:
    </t>
    
    <t>
    	<list style='symbols'>
    	
    		<t>topological location of a VNF instance</t>
    		<t>throughput of a VNF instance</t>
    		<t>energy consumption of a VNF instance</t>
    		<t>throughput of a VL instance</t>
